This codebase has all the code that i have learned for backend.

It has the code for registering the users, using nodeJs, express, mongodb, mongoose, restfull api.
For hasing the password we have used 'bcrypt' and storing them in db.
Also used Json web token(jwt) to authenticate the user.
Also learned to save and deleter the cookies.
Learned the logout feature by deleting the jwt token and adding expiry in them.
